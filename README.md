# My Very First Web Page

## Welcome!

This is a simple project I did as part of my course.
Within the website I used CSS to arrange how my HTML elements 
are displayed.

I also used CSS to arrange the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
Within this site I have 3 pages; Stream-one, Stream-two and Stream-three.

It may be ugly but the concepts are there!

##ENJOY!
